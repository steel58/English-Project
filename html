      <p id="firstQuote">"[...] Japanese sailors saw the U.S. Navy chasing something big, talked about it when they got back to Japan and the story found its way to the filmmakers." page 42. This quote shows how the unknown things get blown up with fiction.</p>
    <p id="secondQuote">"[...] the second kaiju running up on us..." page 51. It shows that while there are scary scenes with the unknown but they're just trying to be themselves and mind their own buisness</p>

      <p id="thirdQuote">"[...] Bella seemed...Exausted. Tired. Out of her element. Sad." page 244. The quote shows how even "monsters" are not so dissimilar from us. It shows that the unknown is not inherently bad.</p>

    <p id="fifthQuote">"[...] something as powerful as a nuclear explosion thins the wall between this reality and ours." page 96. This quote explains that we only see the bad things about the unkown, we only see the "nuclear explosions" and don't see the whole picture.</p>
